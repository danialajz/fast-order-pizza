# Pizza Order
üçï
I made a project called Pizza order. This app helps users order pizza online. I used React to build it, along with React Router to help move between pages. I also used Redux and Redux Thunk to manage the data and make sure everything works smoothly. For the design, I used Tailwind CSS to make the app look nice and simple. With Forkify, you can easily choose and order your favorite pizzas online!
